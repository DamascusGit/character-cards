# character-cards
A collection of character cards for use in AI Roleplaying

Designed for plug and play use with https://github.com/teknium1/alpaca-roleplay-discordbot

GPT3.5 and 4 can recognize the json information if you copy and paste it into your prompt with something like "Roleplay as the character described in this json:"
Or you can get creative with your prompt in gptx api's and pull the data as you like to inject into your prompts.

May need slight tweaking of field names for TavernAI, Pygmalion, etc
